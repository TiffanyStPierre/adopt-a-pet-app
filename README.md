# Adopt-A-Pet App

This Adopt-A-Pet app was built with React, React Router & Firebase. It's a platform where users can list pets for adoption as well as browse pets by category and contact the lister if they are interested in a pet. The app has user authentication and allows for users to update or delete any of their own pet listings. There is also a share listing button that copies the url of the pet's page to the clipboard.
